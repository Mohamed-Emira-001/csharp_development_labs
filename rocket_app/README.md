# 🚀 Rocket Landing Simulation
A C# console application that simulates a rocket returning from space and landing safely on Earth while a control tower monitors the landing process.
## 🌍 Project Idea
This project represents a rocket re-entering Earth's atmosphere and performing a controlled landing.  
A simulated watching tower (mission control) monitors altitude, speed, and landing status.
The goal is to practice:

- Arrays

- Loops

- Console animation

- Basic simulation logic
